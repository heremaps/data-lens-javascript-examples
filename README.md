# Data Lens

This repository holds a series of JavaScript-based code examples using **HERE Data Lens**. More information about the API can be found on [developer.here.com](https://developer.here.com) under the *Visualise with Data Lens* section.

This set of self-contained, use-case based examples is designed to be cloned by developers for their own use.

> **Note:** In order to get the sample code to work, you **must** replace all instances of `{YOUR_APP_ID}` and `{YOUR_APP_CODE}` within the code and use your own **HERE** credentials.

> You can obtain a set of credentials from the [Contact Us](https://developer.here.com/contact-us) page on developer.here.com.
